## How We Capture Data

### JavaScript Client SDK

Our JavaScript tracking client automatically captures user behavior events:

```javascript
// Initialize the tracker
const tracker = new BotDetection.Tracker({
    apiBaseUrl: 'https://bot-backend-i56xopdg6q-pd.a.run.app/api/v1',
    batchSize: 10,
    flushInterval: 5000,
    debug: false,
    trackTextQuality: true,  // Enable text quality analysis
    minResponseLength: 10    // Minimum response length for analysis
});

// Start tracking
await tracker.init();
```

**Event Collection Process**:
1. **Automatic Setup**: Event listeners attached to DOM events
2. **Text Field Detection**: Automatic detection of text input fields and textareas
3. **Question Capture**: Automatic capture of survey questions and context
4. **Response Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of user text input
5. **Throttling**: Mouse movements and scroll events are throttled to prevent overwhelming
6. **Batching**: Events are collected in batches for efficient transmission
7. **Real-time Transmission**: Events sent to API every 5 seconds or when batch size reached
8. **Text Analysis**: Responses automatically analyzed with GPT-4o-mini
9. **Error Handling**: Failed transmissions are retried automatically

### Data Transmission

Events are sent to the API in batches:

```json
[
  {
    "event_type": "keystroke",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
    "key": "a",
    "key_code": 65,
    "element_id": "email-input",
    "element_type": "input",
    "page_url": "https://example.com/survey",
    "screen_width": 1920,
    "screen_height": 1080,
    "event_data": {
      "key": "a",
      "key_code": 65,
      "ctrl_key": false,
      "alt_key": false
    }
  }
]
```

- **30-49**: Poor quality, minimal effort
- **0-29**: Very poor quality, likely problematic

**Quality Factors**:

7. **Storage**: Results stored with response data

### Integration with Behavioral Analysis

Text quality analysis is combined with behavioral analysis using weighted scoring:
- **Behavioral Analysis**: 60% weight
- **Text Quality Analysis**: 40% weight

This composite approach provides more accurate bot detection by considering both how users interact with the interface and the quality of their responses.

---

## Decision Making Process

### 1. Individual Method Scoring

Each detection method returns a score from 0.0 to 1.0:
- **0.0-0.3**: Strong human indicators
- **0.3-0.7**: Mixed or unclear signals
- **0.7-1.0**: Strong bot indicators

### 2. Composite Analysis

Scores are combined using a two-tier weighted approach:

**Behavioral Analysis (60% total weight)**:
```python
behavioral_weights = {
    'keystroke_analysis': 0.30,  # 30% of total
    'mouse_analysis': 0.25,      # 25% of total
    'timing_analysis': 0.20,     # 20% of total
    'device_analysis': 0.15,     # 15% of total
    'network_analysis': 0.10     # 10% of total
}
```

**Text Quality Analysis (40% total weight)**:
```python
text_quality_weights = {
    'gibberish_detection': 0.20,    # 20% of total
    'copy_paste_detection': 0.15,   # 15% of total
    'relevance_analysis': 0.15,     # 15% of total
    'generic_detection': 0.10,      # 10% of total
    'quality_score': 0.40           # 40% of total
}
```

**Composite Score Calculation**:
```python
composite_score = (
    0.6 * behavioral_score +      # 60% behavioral analysis
    0.4 * text_quality_score      # 40% text quality analysis
)
```

### 3. Confidence Calculation

Overall confidence score calculated as weighted average of composite analysis scores.

### 4. Classification Decision

**Bot Classification**:
- Composite score > 0.7 â†’ Classified as bot
- Composite score â‰¤ 0.7 â†’ Classified as human

**Decision Logic**:
```python
is_bot = composite_score > 0.7
```

**Enhanced Decision Making**:
The composite analysis provides more accurate classification by considering both behavioral patterns and text quality, reducing false positives and false negatives.

### Risk Level Determination

```python
def determine_risk_level(confidence_score, is_bot):
    if is_bot:
        if confidence_score >= 0.9: return 'critical'
        elif confidence_score >= 0.7: return 'high'
        elif confidence_score >= 0.5: return 'medium'
        else: return 'low'
    else:
        if confidence_score >= 0.7: return 'low'
        elif confidence_score >= 0.5: return 'medium'
        else: return 'high'  # Low confidence in human classification
```
