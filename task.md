  - [x] `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://bot-backend-119522247395.northamerica-northeast2.run.app/api/v1`
- [x] `npm run build` (outputs `dist/`)

### B) Create Bucket and Upload Site ✅
- [x] Create bucket (unique name, region near backend):
  - [x] `gcloud storage buckets create gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929 --location=northamerica-northeast2`
- [x] Set website config (optional; LB will be primary entry):
  - [x] `gsutil web set -m index.html -e 404.html gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929`

Notes:
- Console setup is faster for LB+CDN; Terraform recommended for infra-as-code later.
- For single-page apps, ensure SPA routing: add rewrite to `index.html` (LB URL map or Cloud CDN/Cloud Run routing). For bucket-only hosting, keep client-side routes under `/` paths that exist.

### D) CORS and Backend Config ✅

- [x] **Updated backend URL** - Corrected Cloud Run URL and frontend configuration

### F) Rollout & Updates ✅
- [x] For each release: `npm run build` → `gcloud storage rsync -r frontend/dist gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929`
- [x] Invalidate CDN cache selectively if needed (set shorter max-age on `index.html`):
  - [x] `gcloud storage objects update gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929/index.html --cache-control="no-cache"`

## Implementation Notes

### GPT-4o-mini Usage Strategy
1. **Cost Control**: Cache responses, batch requests where possible
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Create reusable, optimized prompts
3. **Fallback**: Have rule-based fallbacks if API fails
4. **Rate Limits**: Implement queue system for high volume

### Priority Rationale
- **Stage 1**: Core value - text quality is what Redem excels at
- **Stage 2**: Survey-specific detection completes the detection suite
- **Stage 3**: Fraud prevention is critical for trust
- **Stage 4**: Unified scoring provides clear actionable metrics
- **Stage 5**: Better reporting delivers value to existing admin dashboard
- **Stage 6**: Client dashboard creates new revenue stream
- **Stage 7**: Polish ensures production readiness
- **Stage 8**: Advanced features for differentiation

### Success Metrics per Stage
- **Stage 1**: Text analysis accuracy > 90%, API response < 3s
- **Stage 2**: Pattern detection accuracy > 85%
- **Stage 3**: Duplicate detection rate > 95%
- **Stage 4**: Unified score correlates with manual review > 90%
- **Stage 5**: Report generation < 5s, export success > 99%
- **Stage 6**: Client dashboard load < 2s, uptime > 99.9%
