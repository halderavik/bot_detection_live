# Development Tasks & Subtasks

## Phase 1 – Setup & Configuration
- [x] Initialize Git repo & folder structure
- [x] Create Python venv & install FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, pydantic
- [x] Configure `.env` and PostgreSQL (via Docker or host)
- [x] Scaffold FastAPI project (models, database, routers)

## Phase 2 – Core API & Persistence
- [x] Define SQLAlchemy models: Session, BehaviorData, DetectionResult (+processing_time_ms, event_count)
- [x] Implement FastAPI routers:
  - [x] `/sessions` (create session)
  - [x] `/sessions/{id}/data` (ingest & classify + store metrics)
  - [x] `/sessions/{id}/status` (fetch session + latest result)
- [x] Add error handling: 400 for payload errors, 404 for missing sessions
- [x] Integrate debug logging of raw events

## Phase 3 – Classification Engine
- [x] Implement rule-based checks in `BotDetectionEngine`
- [x] Add thresholds, docstring, and detailed inline comments
- [ ] Write unit tests for keystroke, mouse, focus/blur, scroll, device, network rules

## Phase 4 – Dashboard & Metrics
- [x] Build React (or Streamlit) UI
- [x] Plot timelines and summary tables
- [x] Visualize `processing_time_ms`, `event_count`, bot/human rates
- [x] Implement filters (date ranges, session status)

## Phase 5 – Frontend SDK Integration
- [x] Provide `tracking-client.js` example and NPM/PyPI package
- [x] Document frontend fetch calls and error scenarios
- [ ] Validate event payloads in end-to-end tests

## Phase 6 – Deployment & Monitoring
- [x] Dockerize backend & PostgreSQL (docker-compose)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline to Heroku/AWS (separate dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Configure SSL, secrets management, environment promotion
- [ ] Set up auto-scaling, load balancing, health checks
- [ ] Integrate centralized logging/monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

## Phase 7 – Production Hardening
- [ ] Harden security (JWT/API key auth, CORS, rate limiting)
- [ ] Penetration testing & vulnerability scans
- [ ] Optimize performance (DB indexing, query profiling)
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers, retries, graceful degradation

## Phase 8 – Billing & Monetization
- [ ] Define usage-based billing (per-session/per-event)
- [ ] Integrate Stripe/PayPal; implement webhook handlers
- [ ] Design billing schema: Invoices, Subscriptions, Payments
- [ ] Automate invoice generation, payment retries, receipts
- [ ] Build admin console for customer account & billing management

## Phase 9 – Go-to-Market & Support
- [ ] Launch Developer Portal with API docs & SDKs
- [ ] Implement API key provisioning & usage dashboards
- [ ] Draft SLAs, support processes, escalation paths
- [ ] Create onboarding tutorials, FAQs, knowledge base
- [ ] Finalize legal & compliance: TOS, privacy policy, GDPR/CCPA
