## Frontend Deployment: Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN
Added: 2025-09-29 — Static hosting for Vite React build on GCS with global CDN

### A) Build Frontend (Windows PowerShell) ✅

- [x] Set API base URL: create/update `.env.production` with:
  - [x] `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://bot-backend-119522247395.northamerica-northeast2.run.app/api/v1`
- [x] `npm run build` (outputs `dist/`)

### B) Create Bucket and Upload Site ✅
- [x] Create bucket (unique name, region near backend):
  - [x] `gcloud storage buckets create gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929 --location=northamerica-northeast2`
- [x] Set website config (optional; LB will be primary entry):
  - [x] `gsutil web set -m index.html -e 404.html gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929`

Notes:
- Console setup is faster for LB+CDN; Terraform recommended for infra-as-code later.
- For single-page apps, ensure SPA routing: add rewrite to `index.html` (LB URL map or Cloud CDN/Cloud Run routing). For bucket-only hosting, keep client-side routes under `/` paths that exist.

### D) CORS and Backend Config ✅
- [x] Update backend allowed origins to your frontend domain:
  - [x] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["*"]` (temporarily set to allow all origins)

- [x] Confirm API calls target the Cloud Run URL
- [x] Use DevTools Network tab to confirm 200 responses and CORS headers
- [x] Validate CDN caching headers for `assets/`
- [x] **Fixed AccessDenied error** - Made bucket and objects publicly readable
- [x] **Fixed blank page issue** - Updated Vite config to use relative paths for Cloud Storage hosting
- [x] **Fixed "Failed to fetch system health" error** - Corrected health service URL construction
- [x] **Set up HTTPS Load Balancer + Cloud CDN** - Created backend bucket, URL map, and forwarding rule
- [x] **Fixed bucket access** - Enabled bucket listing for root URL access
- [x] **Updated backend URL** - Corrected Cloud Run URL and frontend configuration

### F) Rollout & Updates ✅
- [x] For each release: `npm run build` → `gcloud storage rsync -r frontend/dist gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929`
- [x] Invalidate CDN cache selectively if needed (set shorter max-age on `index.html`):
  - [x] `gcloud storage objects update gs://bot-detection-frontend-20250929/index.html --cache-control="no-cache"`
