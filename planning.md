# Technical Planning & Stack for Production

## 1. Backend Infrastructure
- Production PostgreSQL on AWS RDS/Azure with read replicas & backups
- Kubernetes/ECS orchestration with autoscaling
- API Gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway) for rate limiting & WAF

## 2. CI/CD & Deployment
- GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy across envs
- Blue/Green or Canary deployments with feature flags
- Docker Hub/ECR image management

## 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics (latency, error rates)
- ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logs
- Alerting via PagerDuty/Slack

## 4. Security & Compliance
- IAM roles, secure secrets with Vault/AWS Secrets Manager
- TLS for all endpoints, encryption at rest
- SOC2 audit readiness, regular vulnerability assessments

## 5. Billing System Architecture
- Usage metering microservice for event_count/session
- Stripe integration & webhook handlers
- Customer portal for subscription & invoice management

## 6. Developer Experience
- Interactive Swagger UI & Postman collections
- SDK distribution on PyPI/NPM
- API usage dashboards and sandbox keys
